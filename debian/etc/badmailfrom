# badmailfrom -- a list of envelope sender addresses from which any mail will
# be declined.  Although of minimal use with most spammers, which as of this
# writing typically forge randomly generated email addresses at any of the
# major web-mail providers or the ISP hosting the zombie sender, but can help
# with some unusual aggressive massmailers or malicious human hosts.
#
# Addresses given here can be complete addresses or hostnames prefixed with
# a single @ sign.
#
# Example:
# eviluser@host.tld
# @evilhost.tld
