# This file specifies the RBL zones list, used by the dnsbl plugin.  It has
# no effect unless that plugin is enabled (in /etc/qpsmtpd/plugins).  If
# enabled, the IP address of each connecting host will be checked against each
# zone given.  A few sample DNSBLs are listed here, but you should evaluate
# the efficacy and listing policies of a DNSBL before using it.
