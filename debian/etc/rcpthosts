# rcpthosts -- this file should contain the list of host and/or domain names
# for which mail will be accepted (either for local delivery or for relaying,
# it doesn't matter for qpsmtpd's purposes.) In general, this setting should be
# equal to the list of local and relayed domain names configured in your MTA.
#
# Debconf will prompt for this setting when qpsmtpd is configured.  If you wish
# to manage the rcpthosts manually, comment out or remove the $include
# reference to debian-rcpthosts below.
#
# The format of this file is a list of host or domain names, one per line, with
# no other formatting.  For example:
#
# mydomain.tld
# myhost.mydomain.tld

# By default, use the debconf-generated rcpthosts list:
$include /etc/qpsmtpd/debian-rcpthosts
